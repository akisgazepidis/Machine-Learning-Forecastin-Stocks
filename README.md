# Machine-Learning-Forecasting

I have to make clear that this project is for training reasons and to help me understand better how to treat a forecasting problem. There may exist mistakes, thus if you notice anything let me know.

## Main Goal
use the dataset which contains many characteristics of BMW cars in order to train some models that can predict the price of the car only by taking as inputs the other characteristics of the car. After that choose the best for use.

## Information about main Dataset
In this project i used a dataset from Kaggle.com that concerns Money control (an Indian online business and financial news website).
The dataset i chose was cleaned.The cleaned data set contains information of monthly stock price values of Yes Bank Limited from July 2005 (the year it was listed) to November 2020 (i.e. current month). It Gives Opening, Closing, Highest and Lowest Stock Prices of every month.

## Model's metrics
In the end my best model was SARIMAX. It reached a Root Mean Square Error: 7.63 and Mean Absolut Error: 6.6.
